Experimentation with implementation of a mutex type.

This is me basically just trying to do an exercise from
[https://marabos.nl/atomics/building-locks.html](Rust Atomics and Locks) before
reading through the implementation provided there.  Odds are it's at least
_mostly_ correct (and maybe fully so, because I'll probably go through and fix
stuff upon reading the provided implementation).  But you would be a fool to
rely on this.  :-)
